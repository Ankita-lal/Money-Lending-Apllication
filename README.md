# Money Lending Application

Overview
This project is a backend service for a money lending application, similar to apps like Slice and KreditBee. The backend is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, with JWT for authentication. The project implements four key APIs to manage user signup, login, user data retrieval, and borrowing money.

Features
User Signup: Approve or reject user applications based on age and monthly salary.
User Login: Authenticate users using email and password with JWT.
Show User Data: Retrieve user data including purchase power, phone number, email, registration date, DOB, and monthly salary.
Borrow Money: Allow users to borrow money, update purchase power, and calculate repayment details.
